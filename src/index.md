# Introduction

## Purpose

The purpose of this site is to act as a how-to and FAQ combination for things
relating to THORSwap and THORChain.

While this site originally started as a GitHub Gist written exclusively by
one person, over time more and more people began contributing information and
reviewing procedures.  At times, even THORSwap staff refer users to some of
the procedures here!

We hope that you find the information here useful.
